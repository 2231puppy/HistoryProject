			<h1>The Korean War</h1>
	        <h2>By Micha</h2>

			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<p>
				In June 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea.
				North Korea wanted to take over all of Korea and make it communist. 
				South Korea was supported by the United States and North Korea was 
				supported by China and the Soviet Union.  
				The Korean war was a very deadly conflict that killed up to 
				1 million soldiers and over 2.5 million Korean civilians. 
				(people NOT in the military).  The conflict ended in a 
				stalemate which means neither side won. 
				An armistice (agreement to stop fighting) was declared in July 1953 and 
				neither side had really gained or lost any territory/power. 
				Today Korea is still split between communist North Korea and capitalist South Korea.

			<h2>Was containment successful?</h2>
			<p>
				In my opinion, the US successfully contained communism in Korea because 
				they managed to stop it from spreading from North Korea to South Korea.
			</p>
			<hr/>
			<h2>At what cost?</h2>
			<p>
				The US made many sacrifices, including soldiers, Korean civilians, money, and time. There is also an emotional impact on the people involved in the war.
				<br>
				The Korean War was not worth the sacrifice for North Korea, which gained nothing and lost many soldiers and civilians. However, for the US, it was worth it because they managed to contain communism.
